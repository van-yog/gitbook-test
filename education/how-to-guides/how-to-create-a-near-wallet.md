# How to create a NEAR wallet

NEAR Protocol’s wallet is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple interface, the ability to select your own user name, and easy options to top up. In this guide, we’ll give you a short rundown on how to create a NEAR wallet, setting you up to interact with [PembRock Finance](https://pembrock.finance/) and all the other Dapps within the ecosystem.

### How to create a NEAR wallet

NEAR’s non-custodial web-based wallet can be set up in just a few minutes. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Go to [https://wallet.near.org/](https://wallet.near.org/) and click _Create Account_.

Unlike IDs on other blockchains that consist of a long series of letters and numbers, NEAR allows you to pick your own human readable ID.

2\. Choose your account recovery method. On sign-up, you can choose from two options: _Secure Passphrase_ or _Ledger Hardware Wallet_. Once your account has been created you can also choose from _Two-Factor Authentication_, either through SMS or email.

a) If you choose the **secure passphrase option**, twelve randomly generated seed words will be shown on the screen. Write these down or copy and paste them into a secure document as they will serve as your recovery option should you log out or need to import your wallet into another device/browser. As no centralized service is responsible for your account, losing your seed words means you will lose access to your account and funds forever.\

****b) **** NEAR recommends using the Ledger Nano S or X **hardware wallet**, as its storage of private keys provides the highest level of security when using the NEAR Wallet.

### Putting funds on your NEAR Wallet

To be able to finalize the creation of your account and interact with any Dapps in the NEAR Ecosystem, you are required to put funds in your wallet. Luckily, there are a bunch of ways to do this in just a few clicks.

1. **Buy and send NEAR from CEXes** - NEAR is listed on a whole range of centralized and decentralized exchanges for purchase. If you are holding NEAR on a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can easily send it directly to your NEAR wallet. _**Remember**_ to send the token through the NEAR network.
2. **Bridge from the Ethereum Network** - If you have purchased NEAR on an Ethereum-based DEX, you can bridge tokens from decentralized wallets such as MetaMask through the [Aurora Network’s Rainbow Bridge](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer) to your NEAR Wallet.\

Buying through these services will then deposit the NEAR tokens directly in your wallet without any further steps.
