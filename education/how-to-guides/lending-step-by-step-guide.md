# Lending: Step-by-step guide

In this quick guide we’ll take you through the PembRock lending functionality step-by-step, giving you all the info you need to know to get stable returns.

### How lenders benefit from PembRock Finance

There are two roles on [PembRock Finance](https://pembrock.finance/), lender and yield farmer. Farmers are able to leverage their current holdings by up to 3x to receive triple the rewards, while lenders provide the funds that make this possible. Consequently, they are rewarded — without taking on any of the risks of liquidation, they can gain regular returns which are auto-compounded.

### PembRock’s lending functionality: step-by-step

If you haven't created a NEAR wallet and loaded it with crypto, see the NEAR Guide for how to do it in the easiest possible way: [https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/basics/create-account](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/basics/create-account)

**Once you have NEAR or other tokens in your wallet, they can be swapped for PEM, REF, or other tokens not listed on centralized exchanges through** [**Ref Finance**](https://app.ref.finance/)**,** [**Jumbo Exchange**](https://jumbo.exchange/swap) **or** [**Tonic**](https://app.tonic.foundation/)**.**\
