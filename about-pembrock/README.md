# About PembRock

## **PembRock Introduction**

### What is PembRock?

PembRock is the first leveraged yield farming protocol built on the NEAR blockchain. Users can provide liquidity, farm with leverage, stake, and take governance decisions to secure the future of the platform, all on a fast, secure, cheap, and user-friendly blockchain.

### Why did we build PembRock?

Yield farming is one of the key drivers of the DeFi ecosystem, with the liquidity provided by users helping protocols to innovate, building new features for the benefit of the entire community. Despite this symbiotic relationship, the DeFi sector is still in its experimental stages, meaning that current yield farming projects can be temperamental, hard-to-use, and occasionally, less than secure. It is only through trusted projects that decentralized finance can move into a more mature phase.

We wanted to play our part in this exciting sector, and what better opportunity could we get than building on NEAR, a blockchain which has made huge strides over the past year but is yet to house a leveraged yield farming platform.

Like our developers, NEAR Protocol wishes to accelerate the dream of DeFi as an integral part of Web 3.0 that is accessible to all. NEAR:

* Is a fast, inexpensive and carbon-neutral blockchain.
* Incorporates a user-friendly wallet.
* Operates with the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, encouraging greater community participation.
* Has a large dedicated community.

One of the most exciting things about NEAR is its promotion of [Guilds](https://nearguilds.com/guilds/) — teams of developers from the community who are creating innovative apps that are accessible to all users, which is one of the important aspects of continued DeFi growth. PembRock Finance is supported by both INC4 and Minerall Guilds in its development.

The NEAR ecosystem is expanding, with volume on DEXs such as [Ref.finance](https://www.ref.finance/) increasing. With the demand for NEAR’s native products and a desire by crypto users to get maximum returns, now is a great time for PembRock Finance’s release. The NEAR Team seems to agree, which is why they provided us with a grant to assist us with the development of PembRock.

### **Update: Temporary Corner Cases**

Having just launched and handling the transactions of many users, some have experienced corner cases, including:&#x20;

* Temporary inoperability or the freezing of funds&#x20;
* Gas usage errors&#x20;
* NEAR wallet maintenance&#x20;
* Other cases of maintenance concerning third-party resources; for example, RPCs and nodes.

We would like to assure you that all funds on PembRock Finance are secure, and we are continuously working on improving user experience so that such situations do not occur in the future.
