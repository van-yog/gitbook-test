# How PembRock Finance Works

![](<../.gitbook/assets/0 (2)>)

### How does PembRock work?

PembRock couples lenders and yield farmers who are rewarded for providing liquidity within the NEAR ecosystem. On launch, we will support two base assets — NEAR and USDT — and integrate our leveraged farming with Ref Finance.‌

#### Lender

The lender deposits their NEAR and earns interest from the borrowing fees paid by yield farmers.

#### Leveraged Farmer

The yield farmer opens a leveraged yield farming position on a trading pair, borrowing NEAR from the vault and joining the farming pool with leverage. The yield farmer gets higher returns due to the larger stake, but pays a 10% premium for the privilege of using borrowed funds.

#### Liquidator bot

The liquidator bot monitors all yield farming positions, liquidating those that become too risky. If a leveraged yield farming position does get liquidated, 5% of the position’s fee goes to the protocol, and is then distributed among those who have staked the PEM token.
