# LP Incentivization Program

On 2nd June, 2022, we launched our PembRock LP incentivization program on [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/)’s [Ref Finance](https://app.ref.finance/). Since then, we have expanded the program to [Jumbo Exchange](https://jumbo.exchange/) too!

In order to encourage investment in PEM and give something back to our loyal community, users who provide liquidity to PEM pairs on DEXes will be able to exchange their LP tokens for PEM with a 20% bonus over a 6-month linear unlock period.

* 1 000 000 PEM will be allocated for this LP Incentivization program monthly during the next 12 months.
* New PEM pools on Ref Finance and Jumbo Exchange are constantly being offered, you can check them out here:\
  \- [https://app.ref.finance/pools ](https://www.polishtrains.eu/)\
  \- [https://jumbo.exchange/pool](https://jumbo.exchange/pool)

### How to take advantage of our program

Here’s how you can start with our LP incentivization program in just a few easy steps:

1. Get PEM tokens through [Ref Finance](https://app.ref.finance/) or [Jumbo Exchange](https://jumbo.exchange/).
2. Provide liquidity to any PEM liquidity pool the Ref’s PEM-wNEAR and/or PEM-USN pools.
3. Use the LP tokens to [stake your shares](https://lp.pembrock.finance/) purchase PEM — over a 6-month period, your PEM tokens will be distributed through a linear unlock with a 20% PEM bonus factored in.&#x20;

### A deeper look at the process

Here’s a quick look into what happens when you take part in the program:

_**$PEM you’ll get after 6 months unlock period = 2\* ($PEM provided for liquidity) + 20%**_

> Let’s look at an example:
>
> 1. You have 10 PEM and the current rate is 1 PEM ≈ 0.1 USN.
> 2. To provide liquidity you’ll need to have at least 1 USN on your NEAR wallet. ([How to provide liquidity on Ref.finance](https://guide.ref.finance/products/pooling)).
> 3. When locked in the liquidity pool, you’ll get shares worth 20 PEM.
> 4. You can go to[ lp.pembrock.finance ](http://lp.pembrock.finance/)and stake your shares there.
>
> _**After a linear 6-month unlock period you’ll get: 20 PEM + 20% = 24 PEM**_
