**Token ticker:** PEM \

**Contract address:** [token.pembrock.near](https://explorer.near.org/accounts/token.pembrock.near)

PEM is the native token that helps PembRock Finance to function. It is used:

* To stake within the PembRock Finance ecosystem â€” with rewards paid out in PEM.
* As a part of our reward mechanism for interacting with our protocol.
* As an additional bonus for those who provide funds to our liquidity pools.
* For DAO participation â€” users can stake PEM to receive xPEM, our governance token.

_**All fees are collected as profit and are distributed among PEM holders who have staked in our protocol!**_

### **How our protocol collects fees**

* Farmers are charged 10% of their yield farming rewards.
* Lenders are charged 10% of their borrowing profit.
* Every time a position is liquidated, 5% of the positionâ€™s value is paid as a fee.

According to our roadmap, in March-May 2022, the PEM token will be on sale to private investors before the appâ€™s launch on the mainnet.

### ****[**LP incentivization program - a benefit for PEM holders**](lp-incentivization-program.md)****

Creating a position in the PEM-NEAR liquidity pool with a 6-month lockup allows investors to get a token reward valued at 20% of the amount they have put into the liquidity pool.
