Impermanent loss Impermanent loss is a risk that comes up every time someone provides liquidity to a liquidity pool. It is to do with the need to keep the dollar ratio of assets in a pool the same at all times, meaning that if one token goes up or down while another stays relatively stable (or moves in an opposite direction), the pool has to be rebalanced. This changes the proportion of your tokens in the pool and can lead to a loss compared to if you just held the two assets. Impermanent loss is indeed a risk but can be mitigated by the yields gained from providing the funds to the liquidity pool. Liquidation Liquidation occurs when a farmer’s leveraged position suffers from impermanent loss, taking on more debt than can be covered by the value of the initial investment. The risk of liquidation rises in line with the amount of funds leveraged, as is shown in this table. The more funds that are leveraged, the bigger the risk should a token in the pair fall. Having debt that cannot be covered by the farmer’s initial investment brings liquidation. No leverage (1x) If the farmer simply uses their own funds, without any leverage, then the risks are no different than using any other yield farming platforms. Impermanent loss is the only consideration. Leverage (more than 1x) Leveraged yield farming brings the risk of impermanent loss, as well as that of liquidation if the loss crosses over a certain threshold determined by the platform. Negative APY Negative APY is a risk that occurs when the borrowing interest rate is higher than the yield generated from farming with leverage. With debts growing faster than the gains that are made, this could trigger liquidation if not properly monitored. Smart Contract Risks If a smart contract has any bugs or vulnerabilities, it can be exploited by malicious actors. This risk is compounded when it comes to DeFi products that are rushed to market or created by those without so much experience in the industry. PembRock Finance has been created by experienced blockchain builders, and will gain an external audit before launch, making sure that the smart contracts employed in our leveraged yield farming protocol are watertight! Update: Temporary Corner Cases Having just launched and handling the transactions of many users, some have experienced corner cases, including: Temporary inoperability or the freezing of funds Gas usage errors NEAR wallet maintenance Other cases of maintenance concerning third-party resources; for example, RPCs and nodes.

"},"risks/risks-for-lenders.html":{"url":"risks/risks-for-lenders.html","title":"Risks for Lenders","keywords":"","body":"Risks for Lenders While leveraged yield farming carries some risk, it is commensurate with the high rewards that can be gained. On the other side of the coin we can examine lenders, who undertake less risk than the farmers they lend to, but nonetheless should be aware of some pitfalls. While we intend to make the lending process as easy and secure as possible, no investment is without some risk, which is why we are here to clearly outline some of the things you should look out for. Outstanding farming debt As we have mentioned in our doc on yield farming myths, lenders cannot be liquidated. Similarly, the liquidation thresholds for borrowed funds that are written into our smart contracts keep lenders safe; however, extreme market volatility can cause these positions to not be liquidated in time. Note that this is a very unlikely scenario. Slower asset return If at any time you wish to stop lending, you can withdraw your funds in a few clicks; however, there may be a slight delay with them being delivered to your wallet if the pool utilization rate is extremely high. This occurs when the amount being borrowed from a lending pool comes close to matching the total value of the pool. In order to avoid this as much as possible, we employ tiered interest rates; that is, beyond 90% pool utilization, lending fees increase on a steep scale up to 150%. This has the effect of encouraging both lenders who can benefit from greater APY, and farmers who become more motivated to pay off outstanding loans. Smart contract vulnerabilities As seen in recent high-profile project hacks, smart contracts can be vulnerable to exploits leading to stolen funds. To counter this, more projects are doing their best to conduct internal and external audits. PembRock greatly minimizes any chance of smart contract exploits due to its internal testing, and the fact that we have hired two respected companies — BlockSec and Certik — to produce comprehensive reports. Both companies have lots of experience in undertaking smart contract audits. What’s more, we also make sure any integrated projects follow the same high standards that we ourselves abide by.

To understand leveraged yield farming, it’s important to understand regular yield farming. Here’s a short summary of each to get you started. What is yield farming? In a nutshell, yield farming is the act of lending your cryptocurrency to the most profitable platforms in order to earn the highest DeFi yields. But why do DeFi platforms require users’ funds at all? It has to do with the use of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) to execute trades within an application. AMMs are a feature of many DEXes, and allow users to make token swaps near instantaneously. The traditional order book model of matching buyers and sellers to execute a trade does not apply. All trades are regulated by algorithms written into smart contracts and drawn from pools of funds (liquidity pools). This is precisely where the user comes in, providing funds to make sure that there are tokens available to be exchanged. How yield farming works Farmer provides tokens to a liquidity pool (an equal share of (usually) two different tokens locked in a smart contract). Farmer receives LP (liquidity pool) tokens, representing their equal share of tokens within the liquidity pool. The longer they leave their assets in the pool, the more LP tokens they receive, based on the pool’s APY. Farmer stakes these LP tokens within a farming pool, receiving extra rewards in the form of the protocol’s native-crypto (in PembRock’s case, this would be $PEM), a different cryptocurrency, or a governance token, which has its won value but can also be used to make decisions through voting within the protocol. In the governance case, the number of votes usually corresponds to the amount a farmer has staked, relative to the total amount of tokens. The main difference between staking and yield farming is that the latter is defined by its mobility. Yield farming often involves the quick movement of crypto funds — either manually or through automated tools — to chase the highest rate of return, calculated by APY; however this is not a strict rule, and yield farmers who find a great protocol can reap fantastic rewards over a long period of time. What is leveraged yield farming? Leveraged yield farming is simply normal yield farming but supercharged! It is the practice of borrowing external liquidity to farm a larger amount of crypto, thus gaining the ability to get increased returns. While many DeFi lending platforms still require users to overcollateralize (put up funds of a greater value than those being borrowed), our leveraged yield farming platform undercollateralizes, meaning: A lower barrier to entry. Fewer funds laying dormant. Greater rewards for users. PembRock gives farmers the opportunity to leverage their existing funds by up to 3x, taking advantage of great yield farming opportunities with a larger amount of crypto, while lenders get predictable and stable returns for providing these funds to the protocol. "},"about-pembrock/":{"url":"about-pembrock/","title":"About PembRock","keywords":"","body":"About PembRock PembRock Introduction What is PembRock? PembRock is the first leveraged yield farming protocol built on the NEAR blockchain. Users can provide liquidity, farm with leverage, stake, and take governance decisions to secure the future of the platform, all on a fast, secure, cheap, and user-friendly blockchain. Why did we build PembRock? Yield farming is one of the key drivers of the DeFi ecosystem, with the liquidity provided by users helping protocols to innovate, building new features for the benefit of the entire community. Despite this symbiotic relationship, the DeFi sector is still in its experimental stages, meaning that current yield farming projects can be temperamental, hard-to-use, and occasionally, less than secure. It is only through trusted projects that decentralized finance can move into a more mature phase. We wanted to play our part in this exciting sector, and what better opportunity could we get than building on NEAR, a blockchain which has made huge strides over the past year but is yet to house a leveraged yield farming platform. Like our developers, NEAR Protocol wishes to accelerate the dream of DeFi as an integral part of Web 3.0 that is accessible to all. NEAR: Is a fast, inexpensive and carbon-neutral blockchain. Incorporates a user-friendly wallet. Operates with the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, encouraging greater community participation. Has a large dedicated community. One of the most exciting things about NEAR is its promotion of Guilds — teams of developers from the community who are creating innovative apps that are accessible to all users, which is one of the important aspects of continued DeFi growth. PembRock Finance is supported by both INC4 and Minerall Guilds in its development. The NEAR ecosystem is expanding, with volume on DEXs such as Ref.finance increasing. With the demand for NEAR’s native products and a desire by crypto users to get maximum returns, now is a great time for PembRock Finance’s release. The NEAR Team seems to agree, which is why they provided us with a grant to assist us with the development of PembRock.

PembRock couples lenders and yield farmers who are rewarded for providing liquidity within the NEAR ecosystem. On launch, we will support two base assets — NEAR and USDT — and integrate our leveraged farming with Ref Finance.‌ Lender The lender deposits their NEAR and earns interest from the borrowing fees paid by yield farmers. Leveraged Farmer The yield farmer opens a leveraged yield farming position on a trading pair, borrowing NEAR from the vault and joining the farming pool with leverage. The yield farmer gets higher returns due to the larger stake, but pays a 10% premium for the privilege of using borrowed funds. Liquidator bot The liquidator bot monitors all yield farming positions, liquidating those that become too risky. If a leveraged yield farming position does get liquidated, 5% of the position’s fee goes to the protocol, and is then distributed among those who have staked the PEM token.

PembRock as one of the expanding suite of products will result in greater liquidity being brought to the blockchain, as new and established users invest their crypto to get great rewards, becoming part of the expanding NEAR community in the process. With the launch of PembRock Finance, we are proud to announce our integration with Ref Finance. A promising DeFi project with growing volumes running through it, Ref Finance provides the trusted infrastructure needed for PembRock users to use liquidity pools and farms. What is Ref Finance? Ref Finance is a community-driven, expanding set of DeFi products built around a core AMM. It is at once a decentralized exchange, lending platform, synthetic asset issuer, and much more, providing: Multiple pools in a single contract. Traders can trade across pools atomically in a single transaction. Customizable LP fees per pool. LPs can charge higher fees for illiquid or highly volatile tokens. Developers can earn rewards for building UIs and other applications on top of Ref Finance. Ref Finance benefits from the one to two second finality and cheap transactions offered by the NEAR blockchain (just $0.005 per swap). This puts Ref Finance pretty much on par with centralized exchanges, helping bring greater legitimacy and trust to decentralized finance. Best of all, NEAR’s Rainbow Bridge to Ethereum means that traders can currently utilize ERC-20 assets from Ethereum on NEAR, with other bridges in development for BSC, Polygon, and Cosmos. PembRock and Ref Finance Soon, the first token pair from our project will be introduced on Ref Finance, giving greater value for holders of the versatile PEM token. With this integration, we hope to give a boost to Ref Finance and every farmer, while also establishing our credentials as the go-to leveraged yield farming project, even for those who have never transacted on NEAR protocol before. How it works Yield farmers and lenders through PembRock will be able to contribute to the NEAR/USDT liquidity pool, with lenders receiving a stable high APY for providing the funds needed for borrowers to farm with leverage. With auto-reinvest, gains are automatically put back to work for even larger rewards! >) What does this mean for farmers and NEAR Protocol? While we are starting with the NEAR/USDT pool, this will be quickly expanded upon release, with other pools added soon. This will allow farmers to use more available tokens to create a leveraged position. As shown above, lenders can also provide liquidity to these farmers, getting high-levels of interest with minimal risk by staking their stablecoins. For NEAR, more money will be flowing through its ecosystem, helping to showcase its ability to handle large numbers of transactions with high throughput and extremely low fees.

With the demand for NEAR’s native products and a desire by crypto users to get maximum returns, now is a great time for PembRock Finance’s release. The NEAR Team seems to agree, which is why they provided us with a grant to assist us with the development of PembRock. How can I participate in PembRock Finance? With PembRock’s leveraged yield farming platform, you can participate as a: Lender - providing funds to individuals who wish to farm with leverage for high returns. Farmer - opening a position with leverage of up to 3x for greater rewards. Staker - locking up your $PEM token for high returns. Governance staker - staking $PEM for xPEM, used to vote on the future direction of the platform! Where does my yield come from? It’s the rule in DeFi that you should always try to understand where your yield comes from. With PembRock, you can earn great yields from both lending and leveraged yield farming. As a lender, you will earn from interest paid by borrowers who open leveraged yield farming positions. As a yield farmer, you will earn money from fees paid by the pool you invest in. Later we will introduce governance staking, giving users another way to earn with PembRock! What is the $PEM token and why should I hold it? $PEM is PembRock Finance’s native token, used: To stake within the PembRock Finance ecosystem — with rewards paid out in PEM. As a part of our reward mechanism for interacting with our protocol. As an additional bonus for those who provide funds to our liquidity pools. For DAO participation — users can stake PEM to receive xPEM, our governance token.\\ The 10% of the borrowing and farming interest profits that we collect from people, as well as the 5% fee that is charged when a position is liquidated, is distributed among the PEM holders who have staked in our protocol! As leveraged yield farming allows you to profit regardless of market trends, the $PEM token has utility in both bull and bear markets. Where can I buy the $PEM token? First of all, stay tuned for our upcoming IDO on Meta Yield, Boca Chica, SmartPad, and Skyward. Moreover, will have the opportunity to buy the $PEM token on Ref Finance, which will be progressively rolled out to further CEXes and DEXes afterward. Can I be liquidated as a lender? No — only those that farm with leverage can be liquidated, if one or both of the coins in the pair lose a certain amount of value relative to the funds leveraged in the position. What’s the fee for using PembRock Finance? Farmers are charged 10% of their yield farming rewards as a fee, which goes to the protocol. Lenders are charged 10% of their borrowing interest profit as a fee, which goes to the protocol. A 5% fee is charged every time a position is liquidated, which goes to the protocol. Have your contracts been audited? Auditing is part of Milestone 5 in our roadmap. Before deploying to the mainnet, you can be guaranteed that PembRock will be thoroughly tested by our expert team and externally audited. We are already conducting negotiations with several companies about this audit. What's the fundamental difference between 2x and 3x leverage? Leveraged yield farming allows users to receive undercollateralized loans, multiplying the investment they would otherwise be able to lock in. This has the benefit of allowing farmers to get more yield, while also benefiting the DeFi protocol through greater liquidity and fees from profits. Leverage of 2x means that your initial investment will be matched by the platform > if you have $100 worth of $PEM, you can now farm with $200 worth. Leverage of 3x means that your initial investment will be tripled by the platform > if you have $100 worth of $PEM, you can now farm with $300 worth. Why did you build on NEAR Protocol? We built on NEAR protocol for quite a few reasons: NEAR’s wallet and Dapps put a focus on user-friendliness. We love this ethos as it will help bring DeFi into the mainstream. The blockchain is carbon neutral, already putting it a step ahead of its competitors. It is secure, fast, and cheap. The NEAR community is great! Its members are incredibly passionate and really believe in the future of the blockchain. NEAR guilds provide great support to developers looking to build innovative Dapps within the ecosystem. We will be the first leveraged yield farming protocol on the blockchain, having received a $75,000 grant from the NEAR Foundation! How do your reinvest mechanics work?

In this guide, we’ll give you a short rundown on how to create a NEAR wallet, setting you up to interact with PembRock Finance and all the other Dapps within the ecosystem. How to create a NEAR wallet NEAR’s non-custodial web-based wallet can be set up in just a few minutes. Here’s how you can do it: Go to https://wallet.near.org/ and click Create Account. Unlike IDs on other blockchains that consist of a long series of letters and numbers, NEAR allows you to pick your own human readable ID. 2. Choose your account recovery method. On sign-up, you can choose from two options: Secure Passphrase or Ledger Hardware Wallet. Once your account has been created you can also choose from Two-Factor Authentication, either through SMS or email. .png>) a) If you choose the secure passphrase option, twelve randomly generated seed words will be shown on the screen. Write these down or copy and paste them into a secure document as they will serve as your recovery option should you log out or need to import your wallet into another device/browser. As no centralized service is responsible for your account, losing your seed words means you will lose access to your account and funds forever.\\ \\ b) ** NEAR recommends using the Ledger Nano S or X hardware wallet**, as its storage of private keys provides the highest level of security when using the NEAR Wallet. Putting funds on your NEAR Wallet To be able to finalize the creation of your account and interact with any Dapps in the NEAR Ecosystem, you are required to put funds in your wallet. Luckily, there are a bunch of ways to do this in just a few clicks. Buy and send NEAR from CEXes - NEAR is listed on a whole range of centralized and decentralized exchanges for purchase. If you are holding NEAR on a centralized exchange such as Binance, you can easily send it directly to your NEAR wallet. Remember to send the token through the NEAR network. Bridge from the Ethereum Network - If you have purchased NEAR on an Ethereum-based DEX, you can bridge tokens from decentralized wallets such as MetaMask through the Aurora Network’s Rainbow Bridge to your NEAR Wallet.\\ 3. Buy directly from your NEAR Wallet - In the Wallet section of your application, click the Top Up button. This will take you to a page with a range options for purchasing NEAR tokens. Buying through these services will then deposit the NEAR tokens directly in your wallet without any further steps. Check out NEAR Names As a fun way to connect friends who are involved in the NEAR Ecosystem, NEAR Names is a service that allows you to gift an account name to someone else in just a few quick steps.

"},"education/general-defi-investing/understanding-impermanent-loss.html":{"url":"education/general-defi-investing/understanding-impermanent-loss.html","title":"Understanding Impermanent Loss","keywords":"","body":"Understanding Impermanent Loss Impermanent loss is a unique feature that arises when providing liquidity to automated market makers (AMMs). It is a real risk that yield farmers come up against, which is why we’ll give you a clear understanding of what it is in this quick explainer. The background — AMMs and Liquidity Pools Automated Market Makers, popularized by UniSwap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, and Ref Finance, are the mechanism by which decentralized exchanges (DEXes) can function. The main feature of DEXes is that they allow you to swap tokens without any intermediaries or the traditional order book technique that matches buyers and sellers. So how does this work? Successful swaps using AMMs rely on two things, liquidity pools, and smart contracts. Smart contracts automatically execute any swaps that occur on the exchange, and liquidity pools hold the required funds needed to make the transaction — no counterparty is needed. Liquidity pools are funded by users, who then receive a percentage of transaction fees and other rewards for lending out their coins; this is where yield farming comes from. So where does impermanent loss factor in? Impermanent loss is due to the automatic rebalancing of funds that occurs when the price ratio in a liquidity pool changes relative to the price you deposited at. Unless you’re farming stablecoins, the impermanent loss is a common occurrence. Impermanent loss is not always disastrous, and doesn’t always mean a loss in dollar terms, which is why it is sometimes referred to as an opportunity cost — impermanent loss means you would have done better simply holding the two coins rather than depositing them in a liquidity pool. How impermanent loss works As part of AMMs, liquidity pools work when the total value of each asset in the pool is equal. For example, with NEAR worth $5 and USDT worth $1, there must always be 5 times as many USDT as NEAR in the pool, creating a 50:50 ratio. If NEAR goes to $6, there must be 6 times as many USDT to keep the balance. Let’s imagine you put have 100 NEAR ($500) and 500 USDT (total $1000), which you deposit into a liquidity pool. NEAR surges 10% to $5.50 meaning your 100 NEAR is now worth $550. This is good for you, but not for the liquidity pool, as there is no longer a 50:50 balance. To keep ratios equal, some of your NEAR will be exchanged to USDT, giving you 524.4 USDT and 95.35 NEAR. The total in dollar terms of your tokens is now $1,048.81, which is great, you’ve made some profit! But if you simply held your tokens without depositing, your holdings would come to $1,050. This means your impermanent loss is $1.19, or 0.11%. .png>) While this doesn’t sound so dramatic, it’s important to note that this was a fairly conservative example. Impermanent loss can be much greater when farming two volatile assets (or less when farming two stable assets). Impermanent loss — things to note Impermanent loss can occur irrespective of whether token prices go down or up. It is to do with the different value ratios between the two coins you are farming. Impermanent loss can be offset by yield farming rewards — if you’re getting a 140% APY return, a small impermanent loss is unlikely to worry you. Impermanent loss is not permanent — further shifts in token prices can cause the pool to rebalance in your favor. Leveraged yield farming adds an extra layer of risk because you can be liquidated before rebalancing occurs, leaving you with impermanent loss, and a fall in the value of your position which is also subject to protocol fees. Impermanent loss is most dangerous when: \\ - One token drastically increases in price. \\ - One token drastically decreases in price. \\ - One token increases, while the other one decreases. To get more of an understanding of how impermanent loss works and look at some examples, we encourage you to look at these impermanent loss calculators: Daily DeFi impermanent loss calculator - a simple calculator based on UniSwap’s algorithm. WhiteboardCrypto impermanent loss calculator - three calculators with varying degrees of explanation behind the calculation of your impermanent loss. "},"education/general-defi-investing/token-correlation.html":{"url":"education/general-defi-investing/token-correlation.html","title":"Token Correlation","keywords":"","body":"Token Correlation Correlation is the relationship between two or more instruments. We can examine the correlation between certain tokens to create a yield farming strategy that remains profitable even through token retracements and market dips. Statistical and fundamental token correlation There are different reasons why one token may follow and/or affect the price of another, but we can group the correlation of assets within two distinct categories; those that are correlated due to an underlying fundamental, and those that are linked purely statistically. An example of a statistical relationship can be shown with ETH & BTC. The correlation of this pair is extremely strong over the long run; meaning that as BTC has risen, so has ETH, and when BTC goes down, this negatively affects the price of ETH. There is no real reason why this should occur; after all, they aren’t serving the same purposes and are reaching into different sectors. ETH is a blockchain solution that involves smart contracts. BTC is a completely different platform that doesn’t support Dapps. Regardless of what the tokens’ functions are, there is a statistical correlation. A fundamental correlation can be found in projects that are linked such as NEAR and stNEAR. Their movements are closely linked as the staked value of NEAR is derived from the token’s original price. Why is token correlation important when investing? Understanding the correlation between tokens means we can formulate different strategies with a high degree of probability about what the outcome will be. When investing in a liquidity pool, it is best practice to put money into assets that move independently of each other; that is, they do not correlate. In holding a portfolio with coins that are not correlated, a market dip won’t affect your balance sheet very much. It is shown time and again that with any fall or correction, assets exhibit multidirectional dynamics. While most things will fall, there will always one or more sectors that grow. This often happens because investors want to shift their investments for more profit, hedge their bets, buy what they believe to be an undervalued token, and a whole bunch of other reasons. In this image we see a portfolio without a clear correlation. Even when there are falls in one coin, others grow or stay consistent. If a portfolio looks like this, the coins are correlated and everything moves in the same direction. This is not a good portfolio to have as market downturns can have severe consequences as you experience losses across the board. Farming in liquidity pools is a long-term game, so each asset should have its own dynamics, meaning you can bring in more consistent returns without experiencing periods of huge losses, which can lead to liquidations and the closing of positions when leveraging cryptocurrencies. To explore correlations between different pairs of cryptocurrencies, you can use a handy site called Cryptowatch. "},"education/general-defi-investing/the-importance-of-diversification.html":{"url":"education/general-defi-investing/the-importance-of-diversification.html","title":"The Importance of Diversification","keywords":"","body":"The Importance of Diversification Talk to any seasoned investor or follow the practice of large investment groups, and you will see diversification at work. Although trading is never risk-free, diversifying your portfolio brings, on average, more stable results, as there is not just one area of exposure. The phrase “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” is popular for a reason. When funding liquidity pools, the principle of diversification should also be pursued. Different pairs have varied dynamics and risks, so as well as monitoring positions and studying a token’s history to get a better understanding of its movements, it’s best to divide your capital across different pairs. Consider correlation In another document in this series, we talk about the correlation between tokens. This correlation may be purely statistical, or because the projects share a fundamental. When diversifying, correlation also plays an important role. Consider you are choosing to diversify your farming portfolio with REF/USDT and JUMBO/USDT. What could the problem here be? Ref.finance and Jumbo are both in the DEX space, which brings some correlation. If interest in this area faces a setback, both coins are likely to be negatively affected. Tokens from different sectors Your LP investment portfolio should incorporate tokens from different sectors, such as those associated with the metaverse, DEXes, blockchain solutions, bridges, stablecoins, and so on. This means that even if one position is affected, others should continue to perform, reducing your overall risk. Other forms of diversification While people commonly think of diversification in terms of different cryptocurrencies and the role that they play, there are other forms of diversification that we can consider: Blockchain diversification - Do not hold all assets on one network. Platform diversification - Hold assets on different platforms. Stable coins diversification - Purchase and use different stablecoins.

They come with their own user roles and terminology, some of which stick and then become the default within the industry. With so many articles, guides, and whitepapers, you may feel overwhelmed at conflicting definitions that are out there — which is exactly why PembRock puts a premium on simplicity. Step-by-step we aim to give you a DeFi education in plain English, and what better place to start than with the main roles users can undertake on our platform. By the end of this quick explainer, you’ll have a concrete understanding of the difference between lenders, liquidity providers, and farmers. Lenders Lending is one of the easiest and safest ways you can put your money to work within PembRock. It involves simply lending your funds which will be used by liquidity providers and yield farmers. What do you get in return? A dependable return from borrowing interest — unlike farmers, lenders cannot be liquidated, so your funds will never be at risk. Liquidity Providers Liquidity providers are those that deposit in liquidity pools. While lenders often lock up one asset at a time, funding a liquidity pool involves depositing two coins*; the amounts of which need to be of equal valuation. For example, if you have $1000 you would like to add to a NEAR-USDT liquidity pool, you would need 500 USDT and 150 NEAR (at the price of $3.33 per NEAR) — an exact 50/50 split. In return, the liquidity providers receive liquidity pool (LP) tokens, representing the equal split of the two assets in the pool. The tokens automatically earn fees proportional to the share of the pool, often paid out in the same LP token, which can usually be redeemed at any time. APY can vary drastically depending on the platform used and the assets provided. Farmers Farming operates like a supercharged liquidity provision, earning those who deposit tokens extra rewards. As illustrated in our graphic below, yield farmers are also liquidity providers, depositing in pools and receiving LP tokens; however, then there is another step — these LP tokens are put into a farming pool, where incentives include high APY, airdrops, the provision of governance tokens, and more. If you think farming sounds complicated, you’re not wrong. There are many different protocols with varied layouts and functionality, meaning yield farming can be difficult. PembRock aims to make it simple, with an intuitive interface and a range of guides to help you access great returns — without having to navigate all the complexity. Leveraged Yield Farming With a world of opportunity in yield farming, we allow crypto holders to leverage their assets by up to 3x. This means they can farm with three times the crypto for greater rewards and execute strategies such as shorting a coin within a position, which isn’t possible to do without leverage. To read more about our ** strategies for leveraged yield farming, see our other doc. *The majority of liquidity pools are made up of two coins; however, products like SAUCE pools on Ref.Finance (USDT/USDC/DAI) require the liquidity provider to add a certain amount of all three assets.

By reading this, you will understand what farming is and where your returns come from. What is a DEX? A DEX (decentralized exchange) is a platform that enables straight P2P transactions using virtual currency. Unlike the traditional order book method and third-party control that is the feature of centralized exchanges, DEXes give you full control over your own data, and allow you to buy tokens without having to match with a seller, and vice versa. The reason that you can buy or sell without a counterparty is due to the fact that all trades are regulated through smart contracts, with funds taken or added to liquidity pools. DEXes require large reserves of funds to make sure that enough liquidity is required to facilitate trades, meaning users are incentivized to lend out tokens that can be used by the protocol, receiving a proportion of the fees and other rewards — this is what’s known as yield farming. Why provide liquidity to DEXes? With many competing DeFi platforms on the market, DEXes need to provide generous conditions to entice participants to farm with them. Simply a share in the fees is not usually enough. Farmers are often provided with higher than usual APY, governance tokens, or extra rewards. Getting a handsome return for simply locking up your token can allow you to quickly grow your investment, but of course, is subject to price dips and impermanent loss as risk factors. How to provide liquidity & farm While there are small differences depending on the DEX you are providing liquidity to, the following steps generally apply. Select the DEX Select the pair Make sure an equal amount of both tokens is in your wallet Provide liquidity to the liquidity pool Get LP tokens — representing your 50:50 token share in the pool Stake your tokens for farming rewards Why farm with leverage through PembRock? Farming with leverage gives you the option to capitalize on the great farming rewards offered by DEXes. Through an undercollateralized loan, you can farm 3x the amount of crypto, generating larger rewards than you would be otherwise able to do. Sound complicated?

"},"education/leveraged-yield-farming-education/yield-farming-myths-busted.html":{"url":"education/leveraged-yield-farming-education/yield-farming-myths-busted.html","title":"Yield Farming Myths Busted!","keywords":"","body":"Yield Farming Myths Busted! Don’t know much about leveraged yield farming? You’re not alone! Being a new sector, there is not so much information out there, and what you can read may fail to properly explain what is a pretty complex topic. Luckily, our PembRock Finance experts are here to bust some of the biggest myths, making sure you get the information you need to farm with us safely. Myth 1 - Leveraged yield farming is more dangerous than regular yield farming Answer: When leveraging funds to farm, you are indeed staking more crypto with a threat of liquidation by the protocol if your debts outstrip the amount that your initial investment covers. Both yield farming and leveraged yield farming can be risky, but this risk can be significantly lowered depending on the research you do on the projects and the coins you choose to farm, and whether you monitor and adjust your position according to current market conditions. Myth 2 - Lenders can be liquidated Answer: Lenders cannot be liquidated. As stated in our first myth, liquidation is a process the protocol undertakes to make sure that losses with borrowed funds do not outstrip the initial collateral that is provided for leveraging. Using their own funds, lenders on PembRock receive predictable rewards based on the borrowing interest rates paid by farmers. Myth 3 - Once I open a position, it can’t be altered until I withdraw my funds Answer: All positions can be monitored and altered; in fact, we encourage this practice! With fluctuations in the market, adjusting a position can prevent liquidation during a temporary market downturn. Myth 4 - Lenders can be exposed due to the failure of farmers to repay loans Answer: This is also completely incorrect. We apply conservative liquidation thresholds to ensure that farmers have no choice but to pay back loans, meaning funds provided by lenders are completely protected. Lending rewards are gained as advertised and then auto-reinvested for even greater returns! Myth 5 - Leveraged yield farming is only good for gaining short-term profits Answer: This is one of the biggest myths in the yield farming space. Yes, it’s true that some people farm for as little as a day, bank their profits, and then put their money elsewhere, but some of this comes out of fear of a coin nosediving or a lack of trust in the platform they are using. Farming reliable coins means you don’t have to constantly move your funds around, and operating on a secure platform like PembRock Finance means you can safely farm over a longer period of time with your profits auto-compounding! Myth 6 - You can’t profit from leveraged yield farming in a bear market Answer: The great thing about leveraged yield farming is that you have the potential to profit in any market conditions. Below is an example of how even if the price of a coin goes down, you can still profit: For the purpose of this example, NEAR = $5 USD You have 1000 USDT and borrow the 400 NEAR ($2000) needed to farm with PembRock Finance with 3x leverage. Some of the NEAR you borrowed will be automatically converted to USDT to ensure you have a 50:50 value ratio within the pool. Your starting position will consist of 1,500 USDT and 300 NEAR. In an event where the price drops by 50% (making the price of 1 NEAR $2.50), the pool rebalances to keep the 50:50 value ratio. Your position will now consist of 1125 USDT and 450 NEAR. If you choose to close your position, from your initial $1000 principle, you will be left with: 1125 USDT 50 NEAR (your 400 NEAR loan will be paid back automatically) If you sell this 50 NEAR straight away at $2.50, that will be $125, bringing your total to $1250 — $250 clear profit. Please also note that you can only profit using this strategy when leveraging by 2x or more. "},"education/leveraged-yield-farming-education/key-leveraged-farming-strategies.html":{"url":"education/leveraged-yield-farming-education/key-leveraged-farming-strategies.html","title":"Key Leveraged Farming Strategies","keywords":"","body":"Key Leveraged Farming Strategies PembRock Finance gives you the tools to farm in any market conditions with the ability to maximize your yields! Here are some common strategies that you can put in place right now with our easy-to-use platform. Strategy #1 - Farm a token pair without leverage Farming without leverage means you do not take out any uncollateralized loans and use only your own funds, removing the risk of liquidation. You can choose from any of our constantly expanding number of token pairs to farm with, with any profits automatically reinvested, compounding your rewards! Strategy #2 - Farm a token pair with leverage PembRock gives you the ability to maximize your farming profits by taking out undercollateralized loans. This means you can leverage your existing funds by up to 3x, with the ability to adjust your position any time based on the prevailing market conditions. Strategy #3 - Opening a long position with leveraged funds With leveraged yield farming, borrowed tokens are immediately put to work, bringing in farming gains while the borrowing interest is paid back. If you open a long position, it basically means you are confident in a token’s ability to rise, which commonly occurs in a bull market. Longing one coin means taking a short position in another coin and can be done when leveraging by 2x or more. Let’s examine how this can be done with the pair PEM-USN: Let’s say market conditions are favorable and you believe the price of PEM will go up. To gain maximum profits, you will want to open a long position on PEM. Go to PembRock Finance and open a PEM-USN position, borrowing the USN stablecoin with leverage. You can put up $4000, leveraging 3x to borrow 8000 USN (which you will short), giving you a total of $12,000. This is split evenly between PEM and USN. For the purposes of the example, let’s say PEM is $0.10 and you choose to farm 60,000 tokens, roughly corresponding to 6,000 USN. In sum, your position will come to US$12,000 — the 50/50 ratio of 60,000 PEM and 6,000 USN required within the liquidity pool contract. Remember, you must return the coin you’ve borrowed, so you are banking on the fact that PEM will outperform USN. As your initial deposit and borrowed tokens are converted to a 50/50 farming position, your holdings will look like this: Long 60,000 PEM ($6000) - farmed in the liquidity pool Short 6,000 USN ($6000) - farmed in the liquidity pool Having $2000 more PEM than your original investment means you are longing the coin with a leverage of 1.5x, while earning triple the farming yields! Strategy #4 - Opening a short position with leveraged funds Leveraged yield farming gives you more options — a case in point; it is one of the few products in the DeFi ecosystem that allows you to create short positions. Regular yield farming doesn’t allow you to create these positions, which farmers can become painfully aware of in the event of a market downturn. Luckily, even in a bear market, PembRock can work for you, with the drop in the price of an asset serving as an advantage. Here we’ll show you another example using PEM and USN, where basically the opposite strategy is employed to ensure you can keep farming profitably. Imagine the market is facing a correction and you believe PEM will go down. To gain maximum profits in these conditions, you will want to open a short position on PEM. Go to PembRock Finance and open a PEM-USN position, borrowing PEM with leverage. As with the above example, let’s say PEM is $0.10 and you choose to farm 60,000 tokens, roughly corresponding to 6,000 USN. In sum, your position will come to US$12,000 — the 50/50 ratio of 60,000 PEM and 6,000 USN required within the liquidity pool contract. You can put up $4000, leveraging 3x to borrow 80,000 PEM tokens ($8000) (which you will short), giving you your total of $12,000 which is split evenly between PEM and USN. Remember, you have to return the coin you’ve borrowed, so you are banking on the fact that USN will outperform PEM. As your initial deposit and borrowed tokens are converted to a 50/50 farming position, your holdings will look like this: Short 60,000 PEM ($6000) - farmed\\ Long 6,000 USN ($6000) - farmed With a PEM exposure of 1.5x, you will be earning 3x the amount of farming rewards you otherwise would be, while having to pay back less due to the fall in the value of PEM. While being able to monitor and adjust your positions at any time, PembRock allows you to get the most from your farming, no matter the conditions. Strategy #5 - Hedging your risk by farming multiple positions with leverage If you’re feeling cautious, you can actually open multiple positions, combining longing and shorting to give you a neutral hedge while still receiving 3x farming rewards. You may be asking, why not just farm stablecoins then? This is indeed a valid question, but we should recognize that due to a lower level of risk, stablecoins usually don’t give you the kind of returns that you will get from farming other cryptocurrencies. Please note, that if you are going to undertake this strategy, it is important to frequently monitor your positions. In a crypto market that is quite volatile, overseeing and adjusting your position accordingly can help you avoid liquidation, especially as you take on more leverage.

With all the different calculations it can be difficult to tell, and in crypto, due to the volatile nature of the market, returns can change quickly due to rises and falls in the prices of tokens. Despite this, it’s still worth understanding how your returns are calculated, and it will give you an understanding of what you’re likely to receive. The difference between APY and APR Both APY and APR are used to calculate the annual rate that you will earn if you have invested money, or that you will owe if you have borrowed money. APY = Annual percentage yield. \\ This calculation takes into account compound interest. This means that the longer you leave your money invested, the greater returns you get, due to the fact that your profits are constantly added to your deposit, itself gaining interest. Knowing how often a position is compounded is very important as it shows you how the APY is reached. APR = Annual percentage rate. \\ This calculation does not take into account compound interest and gives a flat rate of return that does not change. How are crypto project rates calculated? Crypto projects will usually calculate your return in terms of APY, and PembRock is no exception. With our auto-reinvest feature, farming rewards are compounded. So how does this look in a real-life example? Firstly, if farming a token pair advertises ≈ 140% APY, things aren’t as simple as dividing that 140% by 12 to calculate your monthly earnings. For example, a 140% APY may represent a 90.6% interest rate that is compounded monthly, or an 87.65% interest rate compounded daily. Principle investment of $1000 — APR 87.65% Difference between APR and APY Principle investment of $1000 — APY 140% (87.65% interest rate) An APR of 87.65% with a $1000 investment held for one year would deliver a total of $1,876.5. Each day would net you a flat $2.40 in profit. With the same principle investment, an APY of 140% (compounded daily) would also net you $2.40 in profit on the first day, but this would then be added to your $1000, meaning the next day you would earn 87.65% on $1002.40, and so on. By the end of the year, your compounding interest will deliver you $2400, a difference of $523.5. Farming with leverage for great APY As you can see, compounding interest is a powerful tool. While gains may start relatively small, earning interest on top of your interest can lead to great rewards if you keep your investment in for a decent period. While yield farming is associated with short-term gains, we aim to give you a user-friendly secure platform along with educational tools, so you can profit over the long term! In the meantime, you can play around with two cool tools for looking at the difference between APR and APY and seeing the difference between returns using different interest rates, compounding periods, and other parameters. APY Calculator APR to APY Calculator "},"education/yield-farming-glossary.html":{"url":"education/yield-farming-glossary.html","title":"Yield Farming Glossary","keywords":"","body":"Yield Farming Glossary AMM (Automated Market Maker) An Automated Market Maker is a smart contract designed to automatically and instantly facilitate cryptocurrency token swaps drawing on funds held in liquidity pools. The AMM does away with the traditional order book model of trading that occurs on centralized platforms. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) Annual Percentage Rate is the interest earned on an investment over a specific period without compounding. APY (Annual Percentage Yield) Annual Percentage Yield is the interest earned on an investment over a specific period, taking into account compounding interest. Auto-reinvest Auto-reinvesting is the process whereby funds accrued through interest are automatically added to the principle investment amount, generating compound interest. Closed Position A closed position is a trade that is no longer operational, and can occur manually or automatically. Collateral Collareral is an amount of money put up as security in order to receive a loan. Compound Interest Compound interest occurs when interest accrued is added to the principle amount, effectively allowing you to gain interest on the interest you have earned. Debt Ratio Your debt ratio is your debt value divided by your position value, often expressed as a percentage of decimal. For example, if you have 300 NEAR and leverage 3x, your entire position is now worth 900 NEAR, giving you a debt ratio of 66.66%. This debt ratio will (hopefully) decrease over time as you incur farming rewards, which grow the value of your position. DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) A decentralized autonomous organization is a collective of members with rights to democratically govern the direction of a protocol with the help of smart contracts. Management is not hierarchical and power through proportional voting rights are usually conferred onto stakeholders through staking, holding governance tokens, node ownership, or completing certain actions within a platform. Transparency is achieved through decisions that are automatically enforced through smart contracts. DEX (Decentralized Exchange) A decentralized exchange is a platform for buying, selling, and swapping digital assets. DEXes operate using peer-to-peer (P2P) functionality to conduct financial operations, doing away with centralized intermediaries. Most DEXes use AMMs to facilitate near-instant trading, and users are custodians of their own funds. Diversification Diversification in cryptocurrency trading relates to holding or utlizing assets that come from different sectors, fill different roles in the DeFi economy, and aren’t necessarily correlated in terms of their movements. Farming Pool A farming pool is where liquidity pool (LP) tokens can be lent out to gain extra rewards, such as a high APY return, airdrops, or the right to participate in governance decisions. Governance Token Governance tokens are features of DAOs, conferring voting rights usually proportional to a person’s stake in the DeFi platform. Governance tokens can be used to vote through proposals affecting the very direction of the protocol. Lending Lending is the process of providing funds for borrowers to use for farming and other DeFi operations, gaining a percentage reward as an incentive to provide capital. Lending Pool A lending pool is the place where lenders provide their coins that are then used by borrowers. Leveraging Leveraging in the context of trading refers to borrowing a sum of money to add to your principle investment for the purposes of getting greater returns. Liquidation Liquidation is the closing of a trading position, usually where an exchange or platform is in danger of not being able to recover funds from a trader that has incurred mounting debts relative to the collateral provided. Liquidation Threshold Liquidation threshold is the point at which a position is closed. (See liquidation) Liquidity Liquidity in crypto refers to the ease with which tokens can be swapped for other tokens. Liquidity Pool (LP) A liquidity pool is a set of funds locked within a smart contract, used by automated market makers for the purposes of making seamless token swaps. LP Token An LP is a token that represents a liquidity provider’s equal share of the tokens in a liquidity pool. Liquidity Provider A person who provides liquidity to a liquidity pool or DeFi platform. $NEAR The native cryptocurrency of NEAR Protocol. NEAR Protocol A Layer 1 blockchain solution and home to an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications. PembRock is the first leveraged yield platform built on NEAR Protocol. Open Position A trade that is still ongoing. An open position can be adjusted at any time on PembRock Finance. $PEM The native token of PembRock Finance, used for farming, accruing rewards, participation in incentivization programs, and participation in the PembRock DAO. Position Value The amount your entire position is worth, including principle and leveraged funds. Ref Finance Ref Finance is a community-led, multi-purpose Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform built on NEAR Protocol. Ref takes advantage of NEAR’s low fees, one-to-two second finality, and WebAssembly-based runtime. Safety Buffer Your safety buffer is the gap in funds between your debt ratio and the liquidation threshold. A small safety buffer means your are in danger of liquidation if one or both coins in your farming pair drop any further. Smart Contract A smart contract is code that self-executes when certain preconditions are met. Smart contracts automate trades within decentralized exchanges and form the basis of decentralized applications. Stablecoin Stablecoins are cryptocurrency tokens that remain consistent in value to a particular asset, whether that be a physical item (hard currency, precious metal, real estate), or virtual items such as one or more crypto assets. Stablecoins may be backed one-to-one by the physical asset it mirrors, and is often also regulated through pre-determined conditions written into smart contracts. Staking Staking is a part of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, and involves users locking their cryptocurrency assets on a network to ensure the security and decentralized nature of the chain. Staked assets are often held in a validator node or crypto wallet and incur rewards as blocks are verified. Token Correlation Token correlation measures the relationship of movements between two or more cryptocurrencies. Those that rise and fall together have a close correlation, while those that move independently do not. Total Borrowed The total amount of assets that have been borrowed at the protocol level. Total Supply The total amount of tokens that are available for distribution. The $PEM token has a total supply of 24,220,000. Total Value Locked (TVL) TVL is a common way to measure value in DeFi, counting the value deposited in a specific project or blockchain ecosystem. Trading Fees The fees you are required to pay to the protocol for conducting financial operations. Fees can vary depending on the protocol and blockchain used. Undercollateralization Undercollateralization refers to loans that are worth more than the principle sum put up as security. PembRock allows lenders to leverage their crypto but up to 3x, meaning that with 100 NEAR as collateral, you can secure 200 NEAR as a loan for farming. Utilization ratio The utilization ratio is the total amount of outstanding debt divided by the supply volume in the liquidity pool, usually expressed as a percentage. The utilization ratio is often monitored to detect unusual activity and can fluctuate depending on crypto market volatility. Yield Farming Yield farming is the process of investing liquidity pool tokens to receive even greater rewards. Depending on the farming pool, farmers may receive more LP tokens, a governance token, or other crypto rewards.
